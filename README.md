# Overview
This project aims to identify and analyze the health of crops using deep learning techniques. The system processes images of crops to detect signs of diseases or deficiencies, helping farmers and agricultural stakeholders make informed decisions.
# Features
* Image-Based Crop Health Detection: Upload images of crops for automated analysis.
* Disease Classification: Identifies common diseases or deficiencies affecting the crops.
* Deep Learning Architecture: Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.
* User-Friendly Interface: Streamlined for accessibility and ease of use.
# Technologies Used
* Programming Language: Python 
* Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras 
* Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy,Pandas, Matplotlib
* Deeplearning Models: CNN,VGG19 etc architecture models
# Results
The model achieves 98-99% accuracy on the test dataset and comparison of different models done and overall precision was about 80%.
# Future Work
* Integration with IoT devices for real-time detection.
* Extending support to more crop types and diseases.
* Improving accuracy with larger datasets and advanced architectures.
